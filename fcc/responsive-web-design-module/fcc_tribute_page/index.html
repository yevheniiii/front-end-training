                    <h3>February 1986:</h3>
                    <p>Ukraine’s Minister of Power and Electrification Vitali Sklyarov tells Soviet Life magazine that the odds of a meltdown at Chernobyl’s nuclear power plant are “one in 10,000 years.”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>April 25, 1986:</h3>
                    <p>The plant’s operators prepare to conduct a special test to see how an emergency water cooling system would fare in the event of a complete loss of power.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>April 26, 1986:</h3>
                    <p>The test begins at 1:23.04 a.m. Fifty-six seconds later, pressure builds in the reactor No. 4 in the form of steam. This causes an explosion that lifts a 1,000-ton lid that covers volatile fuel elements. Radiation is immediately released into the air.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>April 27, 1986:</h3>
                    <p>As more emergency response teams arrive, evacuations begin in a radius of 6 miles around the plant.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>April 28, 1986:</h3>
                    <p>The Soviet Union publicly admits for the first time that an accident happened but gives few details. An alarm goes off at a Swedish nuclear plant after the soles of shoes worn by a nuclear safety engineer there test positive for radioactivity. The radiation is traced to Chernobyl.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>May 1, 1986:</h3>
                    <p>May Day parades to celebrate workers go ahead as planned in Kiev and Belarus’ capital Minsk despite huge amounts of radiation continuing to be released. Wind, and radioactive clouds, blow back toward Kiev after initially drifting northwest toward Europe. Authorities believe that by holding these celebrations they will prevent panic.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>May 14, 1986:</h3>
                    <p>Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev talks about the accident live on television. He subsequently mobilizes hundreds of thousands of people, including military reservists from all parts of the Soviet Union, to help in the cleanup. They become known as "liquidators." Many will become ill and die from radiation-related diseases.</p>
